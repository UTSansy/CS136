These are two samples of how to "justify" your solutions.

There is no exact syntax... just provide a brief explanation of how you arrived at your answer.


1) A justification of the selection_sort function in lines 7 - 23 of example 6.3.1 would be:

Let n be the length of the array.
Inner Loop: Sum[j=i..n]:O(1)
            = O(n)
Outer Loop: Sum[i=1..n]:O(n)
            = O(n^2)


2) A justification of example 7.2.8 would be:

Let n be the length of the array
T(n) = O(1) + T(n-1)
     = O(n)
